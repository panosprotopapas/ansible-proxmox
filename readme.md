# Ansible Playbooks for Proxmox

This repository includes various Ansible playbooks designed for managing VMs on the Proxmox cluster. The playbooks automate different tasks such as setting up Docker, configuring users, and managing network settings.

- [Add users to Debian 12 VM](docs/debian12-add-users.md)
- [Mount an extra drive to Debian 12 VM](docs/debian12-mount-drive.md)
- [Move the Docker root folder of Debian 12 VM](docs/debian12-move-docker-root.md)
- [Move users's home folders of Debian 12 VM](docs/debian12-move-home-folders.md)

## Future Plans

This repository will evolve over time to include more playbooks and scripts for automating a wide range of operations related to VMs on the Proxmox cluster. Our goal is to streamline and automate as many tasks as possible to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.

Stay tuned for updates and new features!
