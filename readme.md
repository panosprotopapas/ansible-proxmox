# Ansible Playbooks for Proxmox

This repository includes for now a single Ansible playbook designed for managing VMs on the Proxmox cluster. The playbook automates various tasks such as setting up Docker, configuring users, and managing network settings.

## Playbook instructions

- [Initialise Debian 12 VM](docs/initialise-debian12-vm.md)

## Future Plans

This repository will evolve over time to include more playbooks and scripts for automating a wide range of operations related to VMs on the Proxmox cluster. Our goal is to streamline and automate as many tasks as possible to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.

Stay tuned for updates and new features!
